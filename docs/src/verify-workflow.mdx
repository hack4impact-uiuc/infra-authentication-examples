# Verify Workflow

## Verify Endpoint
### Verifies the token, and sends an updated JWT token if the encrypting token has been udapted

| Endpoint | /verify [POST] |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Body   | tokenId |
| Response 200 | success message, role |
| Response 400 | error message |

(1) Check that there is a tokenId in the body of the request

(2) Check that google hhas been enabled

(2) If the user is google authenticated, make a request the google API to get the users email.

(3) Using the user's email find them in the database and return a succes message with the users role and id, or an error message if they aren't in the database.

(3) If the user isn't google authentciated, it verifies their token is valid and corresponds to a user in the database

(4) Check if the token has been refreshed, and if so regenerate a JWT token and return it along with the user's role, autheid, and verification status

(5) Otherwise send a success message just return the user's role, authenticationId, and email verification status

### Example Request 
    {
        url: "http://localhost:8000/verify"
        headers: {
            "Content-Type":"application/json",
            "token": "JRRTolkien"
    }



## Resend Verification Endpoint

### Resend the verification email to verify your account with a pin number

| Endpoint | /resendEmail [POST] |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Header   | token |
| Response 200 | success message |
| Response 400 | error message |


(1) If gmail is not enabled, it returns an error message

(2) Verify that the token is valid and the user exists in the database. Will return you an error message if the user is already verified 

(3) Will generate a pin and send it in an email to the user. Sends a success or error message based on if the email is succesfully sent. 

### Example Request 

    {
        url: "http://localhost:8000/resendVerificationEmail"

| Header   | token |
| Body   | pin |
| Response 200 | success message |
| Response 400 | error message |

(1) If gmail is not enabled, it returns an error message

(2) Checks that the request has the required fields (pin) 

(3) Verify that the token is valid and the user exists in the database. Will return you an error message if the user is already verified

        body: {
            pin: 92995525
        }
    }
    

## Integrating with the client and API


On the client side, you want to be able to

(1) Resend the verification email

(2) Enter the pin from the verification email to verify your account

This should be a step during the registration process, but since it has a skip later option you should also be able to do it on your profile 

Am example of this feature can be found on https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/infra-authentication-examples/blob/master/nextjs-client-example/pages/roles.js and https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/infra-authentication-examples/blob/master/nextjs-client-example/pages/profile.js

You also need to be able to verify all the pages on your application. This means using the ```/verify``` end point to ensure the user has credentials to access the page. 

(3) You can implememt a higher order react component as shown in https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/infra-authentication-examples/blob/master/nextjs-client-example/components/withAuth.js which will only render the page if the token is authenticated by the \verify endpoint. Since the tokens are refreshed every hour, this higher order component can also reset the updated token in cookies every time the token gets updated. 

(4) You should also modify all your authenticated backend endpoints to also get the token in the header, and then send a request to \verify. It will return whether or not the token and user are valid, but also the permission levels so you know how much access to grant  that individual. We HIGHLY recommend you send a request to \verify with the token in every endpoint that needs to be authenticated.
