## Integrating with the client and API

On the client side there needs be a way to 

(1) See all the clients that that specific user can promote/demote, which can be fetched using /roles

(2) Promote/Demote a user by selecting the user, the role you want to promote them to, and a place for you to confirm your passwword /roleschange

The API endpoints just redirect the request to the authentication server. Examples of what this looks like with an express server can be found at
