## Integrating with the client and API


You want to create pages similar to this example in which there is

(1) Button on your login page for forgot passwword

(2) Place to enter and submit your email, which sends a request to /securityQuestionsForUser to get the user's security question

(3) Place to enter and submit the answer to the security question, which sends a request to /forgotPassword. This sends a PIN to your email to verify the account

(4) Place to enter the pin and new password

Examples of what these pages are shown below.

The API endpoints just redirect the request to the authentication server. Examples of what this looks like with an express server can be found at
