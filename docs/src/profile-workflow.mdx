## Integrating with the client and API

On the client side, there needs to be a way to 

(1) Display the user information from /getUser

(2) Enter in your current and new password to change the password to /changePassword

(3) Enter your password, a new security question, and answer to /updateSecurityQuestion

Examples of the client can be found at 
https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/infra-authentication-examples/blob/41d5c4665edb6a0ed2ee6e02bd9e0124ea654190/nextjs-client-example/pages/profile.js

And would look something like this picture below

<img src={require('./workflow-images/profile-3.png')} style={{maxWidth:275}}></img>


The API endpoints just redirect the request to the authentication server. Examples of what this looks like with an express server can be found at
